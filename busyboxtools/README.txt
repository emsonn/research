The Scraper.py script I created takes in the unique.json file as input and creates an output .txt file
that filters out 120k+ lines of listed configuration files that are affected by certain bugs (all taken from
BusyBox's code).

By doing this, I was able to clean up the file and turn it into an easier-to-read .txt file, making bug-finding
and tracking a lot easier to go through.
